Some algorithms used and modified in *TableDataExtractor* have been originally developed by Embley et al.
This is the MIPS (*Minimum Indexing Point Search*) algorithm that is used to find the row/column headers
and the data region, as well as algorithms for prefixing header cells:

Algorithms for duplicating spanning cells and extending headers, that are used in *TableDataExtractor*,
have been developed by Nagy and Seth:

    Nagy, G., and Seth, S. (2017) Table headers: An entrance to the data mine. *Proc. - Int. Conf. Pattern Recognit.*, 4065–4070.

The algorithm for converting `html` files to `Numpy arrays` has been modified from John Rico:
